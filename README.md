# FM-Based-Placement

The algorithm implements Fiduccia-Mathesys partitioning-based placement. 

Experiment with all four placement strategies. (bisection, quadrature, slice bisection, and cut oriented)  

X) The algorithm minimizes the total IC area after placement.

The algorithm maximizes the expected routability of interconnect.
The algorithm minimizes the expected total interconnect length.
The algorithm minimizes the expected time delay of the critical nets.
